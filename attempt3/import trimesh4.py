"""
This script loads a 3D mesh from an STL file and ensures it is watertight and a valid volume, repairing it if necessary. It calculates the bounding box and defines a margin to avoid placing spheres too close to the modelâ€™s base (bottom 5%). It then generates a set number of spheres by sampling random surface points (above the margin), creating spheres with random radii at those points, and validating them.

All valid spheres are progressively combined using Boolean union operations into a single mesh. The script checks the integrity of this combined mesh and attempts to repair it if it's not watertight or a valid volume. If the combined spheres mesh is valid, it is subtracted from the main mesh using a Boolean difference. The final result, with all spheres subtracted, is saved as a new STL file.
